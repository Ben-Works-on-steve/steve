Hi! Welcome to Steve's contribution guide.

**The issue tracker is *only* for bugs/feature requests.** If you have a question about how to use Steve, or about how he works, ask Jonathan#0412 or BoedJ#5476 on Discord.

Feel free to fork this repo and submit a pull request!

### Running Steve Locally
Follow the steps in the README, fam.

### Guidelines
- This is a Steve repo, not a Klasa or Discord.js repo. If you have an idea for improving one of those libraries, submit a PR to one of those repositories.
- Any contributions should follow our ESLint rules and not produce any linter errors, even if that means you need to disable a rule for a single line.
- Contributions should ideally add features that would be useful for a large number of our users, but if you have some random wild idea, we won't stop you.
